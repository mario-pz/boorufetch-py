= A neofetch wrapper that scraps a image from gelbooru

== How it works
* Scraps all image links and picks one randomly
* Visits that site and installs the main image
* Image is saved on a temporary file that gets purged after neofetch is executed

== How to install
----
$  pip install boorufetch

== Notes
* Make sure your neofetch and images work first by running `neofetch --source image`
* The project was made entirely for fun
* nsfw is "off" by default, blame the artist if the art does not look safe enough
