= A neofetch wrapper that scraps a image from gelbooru

== How it works
* Scraps all image links and picks one randomly
* Visits that site and installs the main image
* Image is saved on a temporary file that gets purged after neofetch is executed

* nsfw is "off" by default, blame the artist if the art does not look safe enough
